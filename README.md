Adds geographic location support to pages and posts.

## Description ##

Supports adding geo coordinates or textual description to a post, and will be supporting saving a location as a venue for reuse. Offers choice of map displays.

It supports retrieving location using the HTML5 geolocation API. As it stores the GeoData in a 
WordPress standard format, Geodata can also be added from other plugins.

Offers the opportunity to change the displayed timezone on a per-post basis for those posts from far off locations and set this based on the coordinates of the location.

## Other Notes ##

API Keys are required to use [Google Static Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) or [Mapbox Static Maps(https://www.mapbox.com/help/create-api-access-token/). If not provided there will be no map displayed regardless of setting. The appropriate API keys should be entered in Settings>>Media or within the admin interface at /wp-admin/options-media.php.

The Development Version as well as support can be found on [Github](https://github.com/dshanske/simple-location).

## Venues ##

Venues are locations stored as a custom taxonomy in WordPress using the Term Metadata functionality added in Version 4.4 of WordPress. Venues as taxonomies
have the advantage of supporting an archive page of all posts from that location and giving the location a permalink on your site. To add anything more than a basic location you will have to create a venue unlike in earlier versions of the plugin.

## WordPress GeoData ##

[WordPress Geodata](http://codex.wordpress.org/Geodata) is an existing standard
used to store geodata about a post, user, comment, or term.

**It consists of four fields:** latitude, longitude, public, and address.  

## Upgrade Notice ##

Recommend backup before upgrade to Version 3.0.0 due to the start of venue support. Full location data will not be saved in the post and old posts will be converted. The display name will be saved if set, otherwise a display name will be set from the coordinates. An API key
will now be required to show maps for services that require API keys.
